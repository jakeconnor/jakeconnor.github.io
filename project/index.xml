      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 2018, Ive been part of the organizing committee for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://circ.cstag.ca&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Canadian International Rover Challenge&lt;/a&gt; (CIRC), hosted each summer in Drumheller, Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Carleton Planetary Robotics Team</title>

      <guid>http://jakeconnor.com/project/cprt/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was a founding member of
the &lt;a href=&#34;https://carleton.ca/cprt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Carleton Planetary Robotics Team&lt;/a&gt;, a member for 5 years, and the leader of the electronics team for 2 years. During my tenure, the team built three rovers, attended four competitions in three countries, and took home two podium finishes. I now serve as an advisor to the team, providing guidance on both team management and technical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the time since the team&amp;rsquo;s founding, CPRT has grown from a few space-interested students to more than 50 members under a matrix management system, with dedicated members to business activites. CPRT is on of the largest engineering teams at Carleton, and is the most interdisciplinary team within the faculty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first rover was nicknamed H3, and competed in Machester, UK at the United Kingdom University Rover challenge. The rover drove reliably and arm performed well, but was plagued by communications issues, as the competition was held in an urban location with a saturated 2.4GHz spectrum. Despite the issues we came away with a 4th place finish.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://jakeconnor.com/img/cleared-it.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;H3 Clears a Series of Rocks at the UKURC2016&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/caption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Our second rover was named Waldo, and it was faster, stronger, and more agile than H3. A new arm provided 5kg of lifting ability at a full extension of 1.5 meters. Sparky could drive on flat ground at 2m/s, and tackle a 40 degree incline at speed. We brought Sparky to the first every Canadian International Rover Challenge, and took second place, falling short of first by a fraction of a point.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://jakeconnor.com/img/cprt/pushup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sparky does pushups!&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;caption&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/caption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The third rover, and the last one I was involved in design for, was named Waldo. Waldo brought custom-designed aluminum wheels and new motors for a new top speed of 4m/s (15km/hr) making it the fastest rover at the CIRC. The same reliable arm was improved with a 3 finger claw that supported infinite rotation, allowing the rover to use screwdrivers effectively. And Sparky&amp;rsquo;s 2.4 GHz communications system was swapped out for a 900MHz based one, which provided a full-data rate link even behind large obstacles (we tested through buildings and bridges) at 1km of distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team travelled to the University Rover Challenge in Utah, taking 24th place out of 96 competitors, and again the the Canadian International Rover Challenge, earning a 3rd place finish amongst a pool of competitors that now spanned four countries.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/caption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m no longer involved in day-to-day work at CPRT, but their &lt;a href=&#34;https://carleton.ca/cprt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; will include details of future rovers, events, and competitions. Because CPRT was such a valuable part of my education, I&amp;rsquo;ve transitioned into organizing the &lt;a href=&#34;circ.cstag.ca&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Canadian International Rover Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, to help future students have the same learning opportunities I did.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organic Detectors for Radiation Detection</title>
      <link>http://jakeconnor.com/project/Organic-Detectors/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2016 01:01:39 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jakeconnor.com/project/Organic-Detectors/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As my fourth year (capstone) project, I was part of a team that developed organic semiconducting alpha detectors. The team did not prove that the devices can detect alpha particles, but showed a high degree of sensitivity to light, which is a common predictor of success at detecting radiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical radiation detectors are made from high purity Silicon or Germanium (HPGe), but have a couple drawbacks. The materials are brittle and inflexible, so any sensor must be made in it&amp;rsquo;s final shape. Additionally large detectors require weeks or even months of careful growth, with any impurities or imperfections reducing the efficiency of the detector. A major defect could mean scrapping the entire grown crystal and starting over, and these large detectors are highly expensive.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    &lt;caption&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/caption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The organic materials we pursued are flexible, meaning we could build a detector and roll it into a tube, and place a source in the center, maximizing solid-angle coverage. Additionally the fabrication processes we use do not require careful crystal growth, and could be used to manufacture large detectors with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My contribution to the project was primarily in modeling the radiation interaction with our detectors. For alpha interaction, this was primarily limited to using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.srim.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SRIM&lt;/a&gt; to determine a lower bound on the detector thickness, as alpha particles are easily stopped. Once we had determined that the lower bound for thickness would be constrained by the manufacturing process rather than alpha interaction, I moved on to modeling beta interaction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://jakeconnor.com/img/orgrad/y6.png&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For detecting beta particles, the model is more important.
Beta particles are difficult to stop, and if they&amp;rsquo;re traveling in a straight line, cover significant distance.
Fortunately for the detector designers, beta particles don&amp;rsquo;t travel in a straight line in a detector. Instead they bounce and ricochet around within the material, with their overall path curving, turning, or even doubling back on itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This path is complicated to model due to the speeds and interactions involved.
I implemented a monte-carlo simulation using the Bethe-Bloch equations at relativistic energies. The simulations builds a large number of potential paths through the material, and can the be summarized to extract bulk parameters.
These parameters include effective stopping power, range, and straggle, and directly support the design process for any beta detectors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antennas for Satellites and Space Probes</title>
      <link>http://jakeconnor.com/project/RF-and-Antenna-Design/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2015 01:02:01 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jakeconnor.com/project/RF-and-Antenna-Design/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent a year working at MDA Satellite Systems, in Montreal, designing antennas for various spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary focus was on communications-oriented satellites, with demanding specifications and tight uncertainty budgets. I worked on projects from the early proposal stage, through (successful) contract negotiations, and through the program phase to final testing and shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent significant time on Hylas-4 (pictured above), a High Throughput Satellite with 66 Ka-band user beams divided over 4 reflectors on 2 pallets. As part of the team I worked to develop RF mitigations for mechanical issues, determine assembly tolerances, and produced reports and presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I additionally developed a series of tools used to automatically perform tolerance sensitivity analyses on general spacecraft, and produced simple reporting data on performance effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I additionally produced a specialized version of the tool for steerable antennas, that automatically determined the steering compensation that would best mitigate misalignments, and extract performance metrics from the re-steered antenna. As well as being useful on any steerable antenna project, this tool was used to justify selection of cheaper manufacturing techniques on a large-quantity project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I worked on a series of internal tools, integrating functionality from many tools into fewer (minimizing engineering time running many programs), automating common tasks, and significantly improving the speed of other tools. In one case I improved the speed of a critical-path task by a factor of 4, where in many situations this task was the slowest part of a design iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Freescale/NXP Cup</title>
      <link>http://jakeconnor.com/project/Freescale-Cup/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2013 01:03:44 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jakeconnor.com/project/Freescale-Cup/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Waaaaaay back in 2nd year I was part of a team competing in the Freescale Cup, now called the NXP Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise of the competition is that you have a 1:16 scale RC/car that must autonomously race around a track defined by a small number of painted lines. In my case the track was dictated by two black lines marking the edge of the track, and the only allowed sensor was a grayscale line scan camera, along with an onboard IMU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using an ARM Cortex M0+ processor, the team developed drivers for the motor controllers (PWM), IMU, and camera. We implemented image processing algorithms to find the lines and convert them to the vehicle coordinate system. The lines were used as input to a PID control loop that managed steering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team as we started it only existed for a year, where we developed valuable infrastructure, produced a test track, and were the first Carleton team to attend a competition. The following year the challenge was converted into a capstone project for software engineers, and is now one of the yearly offered projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nonlinear Optics Modeling</title>
      <link>http://jakeconnor.com/project/Optics-Modeling/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2013 01:03:35 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jakeconnor.com/project/Optics-Modeling/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Co-simulation of optical and electronic systems is an important topic, one which I worked on the summer after my first year, under &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.doe.carleton.ca/~tjs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Prof. Smy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ideal simulation for optics would solve Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s equations, but the tiny time steps needed for full accuracy would be incompatible with the comparatively large time steps of an electrical system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we simulate the EM wave envelope, which changes at the same timescale as the rest of the electronic circuitry.
The envelope $A$ propagates according to the rather messy differential equation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$ \frac{\partial A}{\partial z} + \frac{\alpha}{2}A + \beta_1\frac{\partial A}{\partial t} + \frac{i}{2}\beta_2\frac{\partial^2 A}{\partial t^2} = i\gamma|A^2|A$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a team of 3, I developed a matlab simulator that models the EM waves in waveguides and fibers, first based on split-step Fourier methods, and then based on dispersionless differential equation propagation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model included coupling between forward and reverse modes, as well as reflection and transmission at the ends of the waveguide. We verified the model adequately modeled solitons, and even implemented and tested an interference based switch in the model by adjusting the waveguides parameters (in a real circuit, a waveguide&amp;rsquo;s index of refraction can be tuned by applying a voltage or by changing the temperature).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I programmed a small SPICE simulator based on Modified Nodal Analysis, including optical sources and detectors.&lt;/p&gt;
